Bingo game dedicated to one of my fav YouTube series, the Financial Audit. Was hoping someone else would make one, then decided to watch a tutorial on how to create a Bingo game, and tweaked it to what I have now. I hope the Financial Audit team make an official one, but for now, this is for the rest of us.

**GAME RULES**:
- current winning patterns are 5 vertical, 5 horizontial, or 5 diagonal
- currently have ~27 comments, but more will be added
- comments on the bingo board are random, you can also refresh the page to randomize
- each time a pattern is found, a pop-up will display "Bingo!"
